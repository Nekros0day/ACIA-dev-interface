## Arduino based ACIA Interface

Arduino development interface for an ACIA, supports HD6350/HD6850 and MC6850. Whit IRQ support

It's set to be running at 115200 bit rate, so be sure to use a 7.3728MHz clock for the ACIA or change the setup intizilation. Be sure to use a pullup resistor on the IRQ pin.

 Happy Hacking! ðŸ’»
